Benchmark for CC9K Challenges for Python. It is really rudimentary class-oriented benchmarking method, the idea is to improve it continuously during the CC9K project. BenchPress can be used to time blocks of code (timing is based on the **timeit** module), return the result as a Panda, and plot the timed values.
